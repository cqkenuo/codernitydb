Speed
====================

Average record size during that speed tests was **1524
bytes** or described separately.

Number of indexes does **not affect** get performance. It affect
insert performance because data must come through that index.

The platform used for that tests was:

* i5-2500K CPU
* 8 GB DDR3 1333 MHz of ram memory
* Hitachi HDS721010DLE630 as HDD
* Debian Wheezy 64bit


.. note::

    Please note that Operatig system and/or Python will optimize disk
    read calls, in "same ``_id`` get" test there were much less system calls to
    ``read`` function than 100 000.

.. note::

    CodernityDB **never** caches disk read directly. Internal cache
    mechanizm only affects metadata lookup in database
    structure.

Huge insert
-----------

By huge we mean ``10 000 000+``. Below you will find table that shows how
much it take to insert next ``100 000`` data. On the right side you
will find a hundreds of hundreds of thousands (so 195 means 19.5
milions) data that are already in database. Whole test was to insert ``40 000 000`` records. Test was performed with only **HashIndex** enabled.

As you can see CodernityDB performs pretty stable even on quite big number of records inside database.

We can easily compare those data to Kyoto Cabinet for example. Kyoto DB was: ``casket.kch#bnum=5000000#xmsiz=536870912``

*Surprised?*
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you can see while Kyoto Cabinet is quite fast in most cases, it slowdowns **a lot** sometimes (do you know better setup that we should use? Contact us). ``autosync`` and ``autotran`` was disabled in Kyoto Cabinet. What's even more important in CodernityDB you can have more than one index (it affects performance though), so you don't have to copy your data all over single databases.

There you will find statistics for that tests:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Database
     - Min
     - Max
     - Mean
     - Std
     - Total
   * - Kyoto Cabinet
     - 0.629998922348
     - 146.798651934
     - 13.6441506329
     - 25.5503667156
     - 5471.30440378
   * - CodernityDB
     - 1.63907909393

     - 4.57873315585
     - 4.57873315585
     - 1836.0719955


CodernityDB slow downs on when there is a lot of records in database, but as you can see it performs pretty stable. And remember, Kyoto Cabinet is C++ database while CodernityDB is pure Python.

.. [#f1] In get methods it doesn't mean disk I/O throughput
.. [#f2] Gets for unique records in database
.. [#f3] Gets for always the same record.
.. [#f4] That is the total size used by database
.. [#f5] Tree index doesn't store anything to storage
.. [#f6] Tree index stores the same data as *id* one (1524 B average size)
