Deployment
==========

To meake use of CodernityDB (or |CodernityDB-PyClient-link|), you will need just to create global object that will be avaliable to all your application threads etc.

.. seealso:

    |CodernityDB-demos| for several demo applications.


In general you *just* need to create database object and then make use of it. No special magic behind this.
